In December 2017 we helped do data analysis as part of radio 5Live's **James Graham** [report on the proportion of income being spent on Christmas by households in different parts of the country](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42299210).

The story was based on Centre for Retail Research spending forecasts for Christmas, which needed to be matched with ONS regional income figures. However, whereas the spending forecasts referred to *households*, the ONS income figures referred to *individuals*.
